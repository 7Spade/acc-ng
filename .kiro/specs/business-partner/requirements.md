# Business Partner Management - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Business Partner Management feature enables users to manage their company's business relationships through a comprehensive partner directory. This system allows users to track partner companies, their contact information, business status, and industry classifications. The feature provides essential CRUD operations, search capabilities, and status management to maintain an organized partner network.

The implementation will follow Angular 20 modern practices with standalone components, signals, and ng-zorro-antd UI components, adhering to DDD architecture principles and minimalist design patterns.
