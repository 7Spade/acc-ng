## Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Signals Over RxJS**: Use Angular signals for all reactive state management to reduce complexity
2. **Direct Firebase Integration**: Use @angular/fire directly in services without additional abstraction layers
3. **Component-Centric Architecture**: Keep business logic close to components using signals and computed values
4. **ng-zorro-antd First**: Leverage existing UI components instead of building custom ones
5. **Minimal Abstractions**: Avoid unnecessary service layers and complex patterns

### Development Guidelines

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality and add features incrementally
2. **Test Early**: Write tests alongside implementation, not as an afterthought
3. **Signal Patterns**: Use computed signals for derived state and effects for side effects
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling from the beginning
5. **Responsive Design**: Consider mobile-first design throughout development

### Success Criteria

- All partner CRUD operations work seamlessly
- Real-time data synchronization functions correctly
- Search and filtering provide instant feedback
- Forms validate properly with clear error messages
- Interface is fully responsive and accessible
- Performance is optimal with OnPush and signals
- Code is maintainable and follows Angular best practices
