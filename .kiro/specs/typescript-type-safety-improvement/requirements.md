# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical TypeScript type safety issues throughout the codebase by systematically replacing unsafe `any` types with proper TypeScript types. The current codebase has 263 TypeScript ESLint errors related to unsafe `any` usage, which compromises type safety, IDE support, and code maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unsafe `any` types replaced with proper TypeScript types, so that I can benefit from compile-time type checking and better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing mock files THEN all `any` types SHALL be replaced with proper interface definitions
2. WHEN accessing object properties THEN all property access SHALL use typed interfaces instead of `any`
3. WHEN returning values from functions THEN all return types SHALL be explicitly typed
4. WHEN handling API responses THEN all response data SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for all domain entities and DTOs, so that business logic is type-safe and self-documenting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with User entities THEN all user-related operations SHALL use strongly typed interfaces
2. WHEN handling authentication data THEN all auth-related types SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN processing business partner data THEN all company and partner types SHALL be strongly typed
4. WHEN managing contracts THEN all contract-related data SHALL have comprehensive type definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component interactions to be type-safe, so that I can catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components receive input data THEN all @Input properties SHALL have explicit types
2. WHEN components emit events THEN all @Output events SHALL use typed EventEmitter generics
3. WHEN components use form data THEN all form controls SHALL have proper type annotations
4. WHEN components handle HTTP responses THEN all response handling SHALL use typed interfaces

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service methods to have proper type signatures, so that service contracts are clear and enforceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services make HTTP requests THEN all request/response types SHALL be explicitly defined
2. WHEN services process data transformations THEN all transformation methods SHALL have typed parameters and return values
3. WHEN services handle errors THEN all error types SHALL be properly typed
4. WHEN services interact with external APIs THEN all API contracts SHALL be represented as TypeScript interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all utility functions and helpers to be properly typed, so that their usage is safe and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions process data THEN all parameters and return types SHALL be explicitly typed
2. WHEN helper functions transform objects THEN all object shapes SHALL be defined with interfaces
3. WHEN working with arrays and collections THEN all generic types SHALL be properly specified
4. WHEN handling optional or nullable values THEN proper union types SHALL be used instead of `any`

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to enforce type safety, so that unsafe code cannot be deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running TypeScript compilation THEN zero type safety errors SHALL be present
2. WHEN running ESLint THEN all `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` rules SHALL pass
3. WHEN building for production THEN the build SHALL fail if type safety violations exist
4. WHEN adding new code THEN strict type checking SHALL be enforced by default
